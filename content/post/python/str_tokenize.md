## Introduction

Tokenization is the process of dividing text into a set of meaningful pieces. These pieces are called tokens. For example, we can divide a chunk of text into words, or we can divide it into sentences.

Tokenization is the process of tokenizing or splitting a string, text into a list of tokens. One can think of token as parts like a word is a token in a sentence, and a sentence is a token in a paragraph.
